Tableau analysis of Uber data revealed key factors impacting incomplete requests and supply-demanddynamics, guiding operational improvements andoptimizing resource allocation in transportation
<br><br>

🔷 These are the Objectives I was given with : <br><br>

🔸 The major time slots when the demand is more<br>

🔸 Identify the factors that impact incomplete requests<br>

🔸 Highlight the supply - demand relationship<br>

<br><br>

🔷 These are the inferences I got analysing the data : <br><br>

🔸 6 pm is the busiest time and then comes 8 pm, 7 pm, 9 pm and 5 am<br><br>

🔸 -> 1)  Individual days doesn't have major influence.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -> 2)  The cancellation is majorly form morning 4:00 am to 10:00 am.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -> 3)  Cars arent avilable issue is majorly hitting a. evening from 5:00 pm to 10 pm.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -> 4)  Cacellation factor is an issue majorly in the cities.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -> 5)  No car availability is a major issue in Airports and are very less in cities.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -> 2) Demand is higher in the evening especially in the airport area.<br>
